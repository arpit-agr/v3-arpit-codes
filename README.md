# Arpit Agrawal's Personal Website

Hi, I'm a web designer-developer from India. I design and build beautiful, blazing-fast websites that are accessible to everyone.

You can reach me at <hello@arpit.codes>.

## Technologies Used

This website is built using the [Astro CUBE CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/frankstallone/astro-cube-boilerplate), which itself is derived from the [CUBE CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/Set-Creative-Studio/cube-boilerplate).
