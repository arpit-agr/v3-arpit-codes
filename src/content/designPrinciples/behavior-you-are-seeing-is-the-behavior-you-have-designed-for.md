No matter how you've planned, people often behave in unexpected ways. Don't dismiss the behavior, accept that the behavior you're seeing is the behavior you've designed for…whether or not it was intentional. If it was something you didn't plan for, your probably need to focus more on the core interactions more...make them as tight as possible to focus the user's efforts.
