There are many reasons for this principle but my favourite is that designing for a minority makes things better for everyone.

Examples:

- Subtitles don’t just help deaf people; they allow people to watch a video in a loud cafe
- Plain language isn’t just easier to read for people with low literacy; experts find it easier to read too
- Large radio buttons don’t just help people with motor impairments; everyone finds them easier to click
