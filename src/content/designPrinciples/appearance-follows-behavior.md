Humans are most comfortable with things that behave the way we expect. Other people, animals, objects, software. When someone or something behaves consistently with our expectations we feel like we have a good relationship with it. To that end _designed elements should look like how they behave._ Form follows function. In practice this means that someone should be able to predict how an interface element will behave merely by looking at it. If it _looks_ like a button it should _act_ like a button. Don't get cute with the basics of interactionâ€¦keep your creativity for higher order concerns.
