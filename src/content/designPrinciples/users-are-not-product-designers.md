Users have endless opinions about your product, but they are not the designer. You are.

> When people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.

This quote from Neil Gaiman is right on…people are very aware when a problem exists but don't know how to solve (if they knew how to solve it they wouldn't have the problem!) So don't dismiss problems quickly...make sure that you dig deeper to understand the underlying issue, it might only seem unrelated. A designer who blindly followers users will quickly fall prey to their inability to accurately self-report. Do not resent them for this…this is the nature of the user.
